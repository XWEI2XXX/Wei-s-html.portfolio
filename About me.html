    Ciao! I'm Xu Chengwei, a 17-year-old student currently attending Liceo Ulivi in Parma, Italy. My days are a dynamic mix of academic pursuits and a passion for a well-rounded lifestyle.
Outside the classroom, you'll often find me at the gym, where I dedicate time to strengthening my body through focused workouts. Boxing is another endeavor close to my heart, and I've developed a personal flair for executing precise jabs.
In the realm of knowledge, I'm currently engrossed in "Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins, reflecting my interest in self-development, financial literacy, and effective communication. These skills, I believe, are crucial for personal growth and success, often underestimated in traditional education.
As for my academic journey, I'm in the early stages of learning the ropes of web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With aspirations in the vast field of computer science, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead, even if the specifics are yet to be defined.
Living in Italy, surrounded by culture and history, adds a unique flavor to my experiences. While my path in the world of computer science is still unfolding, I'm enthusiastic about the prospect of making a meaningful impact on technology's ever-evolving landscape.
